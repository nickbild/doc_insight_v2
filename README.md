# Doc InSight

Doc InSight provides an augmented reality heads-up display for health care professionals. Relevant medical information from an electronic health record is displayed in the wearer's field of vision when environmental QR codes are detected. The information display is completely passive and hands-free -- no action is required of the user.  A machine learning algorithm runs in the background to enhance patient safety.
